## Loading the gapminder and dplyr packages
Before you can work with the gapminder dataset, you'll need to load two R packages that contain the tools for working with it, then display the gapminder dataset so that you can see what it contains.

To your right, you'll see two windows inside which you can enter code: The script.R window, and the R Console. All of your code to solve each exercise must go inside script.R.
```
~ Load the gapminder package
library(gapminder)
~ Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
~ Look at the gapminder dataset
gapminder
```
