[chapter 4.pdf](https://github.com/theadewole/My_R_Note/files/14445160/chapter.4.pdf) <br>
- Using log transformation and other (square root etc) to attain better correlation between two variables when the distribution is skewed
- Correlation does not imply causation. This means that if x and y are correlated, x doesn't necessarily cause y.
A phenomenon called confounding can lead to spurious correlations (when a correlation between x and y does not lead to causation). A cofounding is a hidden variable. <br>
A correlation result shows that coffee causes cancer however there is a cofounding at play called smoking
