**Definitions** <br>
- A hypothesis is a statement about an unknown population parameter.
- A hypothesis test is a test of two competing hypotheses. 
  - The null hypothesis (H ) is the existing "champion" idea.
      - The alternative hypothesis (H ) is the new "challenger" idea of the researcher. <br>
      
The null hypothesis is like the current champion, and the alternative hypothesis is like a challenger trying to overthrow that champion. Here, the null hypothesis is that our data won't tell us anything new, The alternative hypothesis is that our hunch is correct.

**p-values quantify evidence for the null hypothesis.** <br>
- Large p-value → fail to reject null hypothesis.
  - Small p-value → reject null hypothesis.
