A t test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. 
It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another.
Example <br>
You want to know whether the mean petal length of iris flowers differs according to their species.
You find two different species of irises growing in a garden and measure 25 petals of each species. You can test the difference between these two groups using a t test and null and alterative hypotheses.
- The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true difference between these group means is zero.
- The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is that the true difference is different from zero. <br>
The t test assumes your data:
- Are independent
- Are (approximately) normally distributed
- Have a similar amount of variance within each group being compared (a.k.a. homogeneity of variance) <br>
## One Sample T – Test Approach
The One-Sample T-Test is used to test the statistical difference between a sample mean and a known or assumed/hypothesized value of the mean in the population
## Two sample T-Test Approach
It is used to help us to understand whether the difference between the two means is real or simply by chance. 
## Paired Sample T-test
This is a statistical procedure that is used to determine whether the mean difference between two sets of observations is zero. 
In a paired sample t-test, each subject is measured two times, resulting in pairs of observations.

|Test                   | Purpose | Data | Hypothesis | Asumption | Examples | 
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|----------|------------|---------|
|One-sample t-test | Determines whether a single sample’s mean deviates considerably from a given population mean.| Analyses a single set of measurements or observations. | Tests whether a population mean is hypothesized to be significantly different from the sample mean.|Assumes that observations are independent and that the data is regularly distributed. | Examining whether a class’s average test scores considerably deviate from the average test score for the country, for instance.|
